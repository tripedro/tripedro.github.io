                            First and foremost, START APPLYING EARLY. This was something I was fortunate to be able to do, and I believe it led to a lot of the success I had in applying. Second, REVIEW YOUR RESUME, I spent so much time on my resume, and probably had over 10 other people critique my resume, and in all honesty, still feel there's so much more I could improve on. Third, ATTEND JOB FAIRS & RESEARCH WHERE YOUR APPLYING, I loved sitting at home and spamming applications, but felt I had the best chances at companies I got to speak with face to face. The way I succeeded in these conversations was cutting out the section where they would need to explain the basis of what the companies are about, by researching it, and getting right into the juicy questions. There are more factors, but I am going to cut entry off here, feel free to email me if you want to hear more about my experiences.

                            One of my biggest challenges this semester was working part-time, 20 hours a week, while taking 15 credit hours at TXST. The way I combatted this hardship was creating a schedule where I could allot time for my class work, research work, and personal time. I spent a lot of time on campus, working in the library between classes, this is where I got most of my class and research work done, and was way more productive than being at home. If you happen to struggle with doing too much at one time, the advice I offer is, make a schedule, work away from home, write all of your tasks in a notebook, and frequent that notebook plenty.

                            Decided to add a personal blog section to my portfolio. I am just going to ramble
                            about various things related to my experiences, or just things I want to talk about.
                            Feel free to reach out to me if you have any ideas of something I should write about!
